<h1>About</h1>

<p>ManeStage Theatre Company is an independent, non-profit 501(c)(3) corporation funded by ticket sales and the support of volunteers and community contributors.  We debuted our first production, The Wizard of Oz,  in February of 2008.  Our production of Hello, Dolly! in July 2015 marked our 50th production! ManeStage Theatre Company was founded by Jay and Brenda Henson who have over 50 years of combined theatre experience.  They received their education and worked professionally in the theatre  industry in the Los Angeles area before moving to Washington State. Combining their extensive experience and education, they have brought together a group of very talented and dedicated volunteers to create a theatre company to serve the eastern Pierce County area with professional, family oriented* entertainment.</p>

<p>ManeStage places a high priority on being a safe haven for artists of all ages and values each individual and treats them with equal respect.  Because of this, ManeStage has become an ever growing family of volunteers that take pride in serving the community through the arts and offering a place where individuals can experience all aspects of live theatre, both on stage and behind the scenes in a supportive and encouraging environment.  We work with hundreds of volunteers each season to produce five musicals and one play, and offer high-quality youth education programs as well as a summer camp program each year.</p>

<p>Our productions are family oriented, however, we are not a children's theatre.  All of our productions are rated PG as we feel it is up to the parents to decide what is appropriate for their family as it may differ from family to family.  We recommend that concerned parents spend time researching a show in order to decide if the content is appropriate for their individual family guidelines and/or for the age of their children.  As a courtesy to our audiences and performers, we have a policy of no children under 3 or babes in arms. When children are old enough to join the audience, we encourage parents to instruct them in proper theatre behavior.</p>
